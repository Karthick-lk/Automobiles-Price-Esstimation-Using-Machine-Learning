⦿ An AI/ML Based Automobile Price Estimation Project, Using Machine Learning Algorithms and Techniques to Predict the Value of a Vehicle Based on Various Factors Such as its Make, Model, Year, Mileage, Condition, and Other Relevant Features. 

⦿ The Project Typically Involves Collecting and Cleaning a Large Dataset of Vehicle Prices and Features, Selecting and Training a Suitable Machine Learning Model Using the Data, and then Evaluating the Model's Performance on a Test Set.

⦿ Worked With MySql , Postman API, HTML ,CSS, JavaScript and Flask to Bulit a Web APP.
